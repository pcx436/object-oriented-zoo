# Object Oriented Zoo
This is the first project for Object Oriented Analysis and Design (CSCI-4448). The idea behind this project is to
exhibit class inheritance principles through a hierarchical structure of animal classes.

## Comments and Assumptions
* What to put for the different sounds that animals make (hippo sounds).
* There is no cap on the age for both the Zoo Employees or Animals. Therefore, they can theoretically live forever.
* We also assumed that negative numbers would not be entered for the day the user is
asked to enter or the age of animals.


## Credits
This project was completed by Jacob Malcy, Kyle Stewart, and Vincent Liu.
